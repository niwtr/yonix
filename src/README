Welcome to YONIX, a simple, hackable operating system.
It is designed to be flexible and experimentable.
Our system provides the features below:
1. Fast scheduler. Each scheduler guarantees O(1) scheduling time.
2. Full features. We cover all of the functions from scheduling to IO.
3. Freedom. Our OS provides with some highly functional system calls, for example:
   * incnice/decnice: increase/decrease nice val.
   * lwp creation. Creates light weight processes.
   * dynamic-store and dynamic-restart. Much similar to C's setjmp & longjmp.
   * semaphore and mutex.
   * setsched syscall, online changing schedule algorithm.
Hacks & glory awaits!
